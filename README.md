# Ripple-Health
A DeFi medical payment and crowdfunding platform built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL)

## Description
Crowdfund & Connect is a decentralized finance (DeFi) healthcare payment platform built on the XRP Ledger. It enables direct doctor-to-patient billing, peer-to-peer payments, and built-in medical crowdfunding without relying on traditional financial methods.

The platform increases trust, transparency, and accessibility in healthcare payments using blockchain technology.

## Features
- **On-Chain Doctor Verification (XRPL Credentials)**
    Doctors are verified using XRPL's native Credentials amendment. When an admin verifies a doctor, the platform issues a `VerifiedDoctor` credential on-chain via `CredentialCreate`. The doctor then accepts it via `CredentialAccept`, making their verification publicly visible on the ledger. Campaigns and invoices display an "On-Chain Verified" badge when the credential is accepted. Credentials can also be revoked on-chain via `CredentialDelete`.

- **Direct Doctor-to-Patient Billing**
    Verified doctors post treatment invoices on-chain. Each invoice includes doctor ID, patient ID, amount, treatment description, and timestamp. Patients can instantly pay the invoice using XRP.

- **Built-In Medical Crowdfunding**
    If a patient cannot afford treatment, they can enable crowdfunding on their invoice. The invoice becomes a public campaign where donors can view the verified doctor profile, see the treatment type, and contribute directly in XRP. This removes fraud risk by ensuring all requests originate from verified doctors.

- **Doctor Reserve Accounts**
    Doctors can maintain a reserve account balance. If crowdfunding falls short, the doctor can cover the gap from their reserve to ensure the patient receives care immediately.

- **Crawlback (Fraud Protection)**
    Any user can report a suspicious invoice. Admins can redact fraudulent invoices, preventing further payments. This protects donors and patients from bad actors.

- **Peer-to-Peer Payments**
    All payments settle on the XRP Ledger -- no financial institution required. Direct wallet-to-wallet transfers with fast settlement and low network fees.

Open **http://127.0.0.1:5000** in your browser.

### 4. Test Flow
1. Go to `/doctors/signup` and register a doctor account

3. Log in as the doctor at `/doctors/login` → doctor dashboard
4. Fund your wallet (testnet faucet button)
5. Create an invoice for the patient (use patient's user ID)
6. Log out, log in as patient at `/patients/login` → patient dashboard
7. Fund wallet, then pay the invoice or enable crowdfunding
8. Log in as a donor to contribute to crowdfunding campaigns

## On-Chain Doctor Verification (XRPL Credentials)

CrowdCare uses XRPL's native **Credentials** amendment to verify doctors on-chain:

1. **Admin verifies a doctor** (`PUT /api/users/<id>/verify`) — the platform's issuer account issues a `VerifiedDoctor` credential to the doctor's XRP address.
2. **Doctor accepts the credential** (`POST /api/credentials/accept`) — the credential is accepted on-chain and becomes visible to anyone querying the ledger.
3. **Campaigns show on-chain status** — if the issuing doctor's credential is accepted, campaigns display an "On-Chain Verified" badge.
4. **Revocation** (`PUT /api/users/<id>/revoke`) — the admin can revoke verification, which also deletes the credential from the ledger.

**Setup**: Set the `ISSUER_SEED` environment variable to a funded XRPL testnet account seed. The platform uses this account to issue and revoke credentials.

### Handling Ambiguous XRPL Responses

During development we encountered a recurring issue with `xrpl-py`'s `submit_and_wait` function: credential transactions (`CredentialCreate`, `CredentialAccept`) would succeed on the ledger but the function would either return an empty `engine_result` or throw an `XRPLReliableSubmissionException` before confirming the outcome. This caused the API to report failure even though the credential was actually written on-chain.

**Symptoms observed:**
- `submit_and_wait` returns a response with an empty `engine_result` — the transaction landed but the result field is missing
- `submit_and_wait` throws `XRPLReliableSubmissionException: Transaction failed: tecDUPLICATE` on a second attempt, proving the first attempt did succeed
- The UI shows "Failed to accept credential" but on page reload the credential appears as accepted

**How we solved it:**
Both `issue_credential` and `accept_credential` now use a **ledger-query fallback**. When the response is ambiguous (empty result code, exception, or non-`tesSUCCESS` code), the functions query the doctor's `AccountObjects` on-chain to check whether the credential actually exists and is accepted. If it does, the operation is reported as successful. This handles three cases:
1. **Normal return with empty `engine_result`** — falls back to ledger query
2. **`tecDUPLICATE` exception** — credential already exists, treated as success
3. **Other exceptions** — ledger query determines if the transaction landed despite the error

This pattern ensures the API never falsely reports failure when the on-chain state confirms success.

## Future Developments

### Escrow-Based Crowdfunding
Currently, crowdfunding contributions are sent directly to the doctor's wallet. A more secure approach would use [XRPL Escrow](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/payment-types/escrow) to hold funds until the campaign goal is met or a deadline passes. If the goal isn't reached, escrowed funds automatically return to donors — no trust required. This also strengthens the crawlback mechanism: if an invoice is reported as fraudulent while contributions are still in escrow, the escrow can be cancelled before funds are ever released to the doctor.

### Check-Based Crawlback Refunds
When a fraudulent invoice is redacted, there is currently no mechanism to recover funds already paid. [XRPL Checks](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/payment-types/checks) would allow the platform to require the doctor to issue a Check back to the patient or donors. The Check sits on-chain until the recipient is ready to cash it, providing a non-custodial refund path that doesn't require the doctor and recipient to be online at the same time.

### Decentralized Identity (DID)
Doctor and patient identities currently live only in the SQLite database. [XRPL DID](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/decentralized-identifiers) would allow each user to have a verifiable, portable on-chain identity tied to their XRP account. A doctor's verification status, credentials, and history could be queried directly from the ledger by any application — not just this platform. This moves trust from a single database to the decentralized ledger, enabling interoperability with other healthcare or identity systems.
